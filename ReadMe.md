# XX Coding Club 
The goal is to provide you with the tools and understanding to get programming on your own.
- If in doubt, just come to a session!
- We are always reviewing what we have done previously and do activities in groups so that there is always someone to help you get caught up! 

**UBC LSI,Tuesdays at 4:30 pm**  ** **LOCATION CHANGES! (see schedule below)** **

See the .Rmd recap files / Day folders to see what we have been up to each day and what we plan to do during the next time. 

We are using the [Issues](https://github.com/ahofmann4/XX_CodingClub/issues) section to post coding challenges that help practice what we are learning. Also, post any lesson ideas as a new issue! Nothing is too simple or silly to post to the issues to get some help!! 

We recently also started using [Projects](https://github.com/ahofmann4/XX_CodingClub/projects) to help focus our tasks for practice sets, and lessons we want to see. We welcome any and all contributions and suggestions!
