knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
# Intro to R Studio
- demonstrated the different parts of R Studio: command line, Environment (where to see your variables, History - the record of code run on the command line, Git - how to commit and push changes and work, Files - use to look at files present, Plots - where graphs will pop up, Packagse - where you can find the packages you have installed (checked ones loaded and 'active'), Help - use to search help documentation on commands, Viewer - use to look at knitHtml files (from .Rmd files) )
- made a new R Project with a github repository

## R Markdown Review of tempate when you open a new .Rmd file
**We also looked at a Markdown [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)**

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Other Misc Resources we discussed

### Useful packages to install and start exploring
1. ReadR
1. TidyR
1. dplyR
1. ggplot2

### Useful programming content to review mechanisms of
1. for loops
1. while loops
1. if statements
1. how to write a function

### Useful function
As promised, I am sharing the create_empty_table function I found on stackoverflow
*I also documented the function with useful comments as an example of good code documentation*
```{r, create and empty table with NAs}

create_empty_table <- function(num_rows, num_cols) {
  # This function creates an empty table filled with NA according to the dimensions you specfy
  # num_rows - takes a positive integer as the argument
  # num_cols - takes a positive integer as the argument
    frame <- data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = num_rows, ncol = num_cols))
    return(frame)
}

```

## Upcoming programming workshop that may be of interest
[SFU & UBC Library Research Commons: Research Bazaar 2017](http://guides.library.ubc.ca/library_research_commons/resbaz2017)

## Next Week
### To prepare
1. review this document and any skills you want to brush up on or get help with
1. make a github account, install github desktop (practice using this if you have a chance)

### Further Suggestions
1. think about something that you do that could benefit from some R functions, and how you could talke it one step at a time

### Agenda for day 2 - Thursday Feb 3rd, 8am LSI
1. get set-up on a private github repository to work on Connie's code
.. *we will be using github as a tool to collaborate on this project together (I will walk through how to do this, but some review of online how to's of this would be useful)*
1. work on conceptualizing Connie's workflow and making some of her code into functions
